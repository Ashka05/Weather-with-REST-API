# Weather-with-REST-API
Developed a dynamic weather website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating REST APIs to display real-time weather data. The website allows users to search for any city and instantly view current temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts in a clean, user-friendly interface.

A personalized API key from OpenWeatherAPI was implemented to authenticate requests securely and ensure reliable access to up-to-date weather information. This project strengthened my skills in API integration, asynchronous data fetching using JavaScript fetch calls, and managing secure API keys within server-side code. It also improved my understanding of handling JSON responses and building responsive, interactive web applications.
